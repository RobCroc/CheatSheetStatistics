| Paired t-test                  | Parametric    | Compare means of paired/related samples                     | Differences are normally distributed; paired observations                | Paired difference plot, Line plot connecting paired observations, Box plot of differences |
| ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)   | Parametric    | Compare means across three or more groups                   | Normality, homogeneity of variances, independence                          | Box plot for group comparisons, Means plot with error bars, Bar plot            |
| Pearson’s Correlation          | Parametric    | Measure linear relationship between two continuous variables  | Normality, linearity, continuous data                                    | Scatter plot with best-fit regression line                                    |
| Linear Regression              | Parametric    | Model relationships between a dependent variable and predictors| Linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normally distributed residuals  | Scatter plot with regression line, Residual plots                             |
| Mann-Whitney U Test            | Nonparametric | Compare medians of two independent groups                   | Ordinal or continuous data; does not assume normality                    | Box plot, Violin plot                                                         |
| Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test      | Nonparametric | Compare medians of paired samples                           | Paired observations; ordinal or continuous data                          | Box plot of differences, Scatter plot with lines connecting paired samples    |
| Kruskal-Wallis Test            | Nonparametric | Compare medians among three or more independent groups      | Ordinal or continuous data; independent groups                           | Box plot or Violin plot per group                                             |
| Spearman’s Rank Correlation    | Nonparametric | Assess monotonic relationship between two variables         | Ordinal or continuous data; can handle non-linear relationships            | Scatter plot (often with a trend line based on ranks)                         |
| Chi-Square Test                | Nonparametric | Test for association between categorical variables          | Expected frequencies sufficiently large; independence of observations      | Bar chart, Mosaic plot                                                        |
| Friedman Test                  | Nonparametric | Compare medians across repeated measures or matched groups    | Ordinal or continuous data; repeated measures design                     | Box plots for each condition, Line plot showing trends for individual subjects|
